## What is it ?
Egybiotech was established in August 2012 as a private research organization working primarily in the area of health research with focus on biotechnology research applications. Besides conducting commissioned research projects and conducting research training workshops, our main interest is to develop our own biotech products; and conduct our own research programs. We have a broad research portfolio in various areas of cancer research, health service evaluation, and research at the interface of health and social science. The main focus is to produce, validate and patent molecular diagnostics based on multi-gene assays capable of predicting incidence or outcome of disease or treatment.
